## Project Description
This project is a clone of the [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) website, which showcases the best web design trends along with their ratings based on their design, usability, creativity and content. The project mimics the behaviour of this website by enabling users to upload their projects, view other users' projects and vote on them, search for various projects as well as updating their profile details among other functionalities. The application also implements a solid authentication system whereby users should be authorized before using the application.
